"""Examine the intervals between triggers

Here we look at the intervals between consecutive triggers in a station.
The station should have data reduction and the mean filter disabled.
This is to look for overlapping traces. This means that the trace of the
second event should start less than 6 us after the first.

Todo: fix t_trigger reconstruction for station 501.
