""" Try to do an offline reconstruction of the trace variables.

The new DAQ (v4) uses a lower threshold for the integral and baseline.
This needs to be selected if these traces are reconstructed.

If the mean filter is enabled the reconstruction does not work because
the DAQ used the raw traces for the reconstruction.

If data reduction is enabled on the old DAQ to much of the traces
are cut away, preventing reconstruction of the baselines.
Additionally small pulsheights in channels without big signals (below
baseline_threshold) may be cut away, preventing their reconstruction
However, due to the tiny pulses these are uninteressting anyway.
